Use Facebook api graph tool to debug query strings.

Use chrome debugger. views->developer tools
see console log tab (always keep open)
While developer tools open, right click on reload button and choose hard 
    reload for any .js file (open this through 'view frame souce' option)

Safari debugger
I added a button next to nav bar to open dev tools
Use cmd-alt-E to remove caches, cmd-R to reload

GAE:
On GAE (app engine) a project is not the same as a VM 'instance'. For free account
you create projects and deploy (you could use their git or deploy with github).
They spin up instances and charge you. If you want dedicated instance then you pay.
Free account, after daily quota charges more for per hour instance use than
paid instance.

====
Marketing
When you search for Zouk on the internet, what do you get? Mostly incomplete
and outdated lists. When you are planning to travel, or when you are 
already in a place and looking for Zouk events you want a list of
current Zouk events happening around the area. Real time.

    <!--
      FB first makes a request to server with a signed-request. This has access-token in it.
      So server side should already have correct FB app-id. Then server sends this index.php
      after processing all php. Client (browser) proceeds to load this page in addition to
      processing Javascript in this page.

      You can search FB from client side or server side. First check if app has permission,
      otherwise prompt for login.
      Server side FB search: After login, or if access-token is obtained from pageHelper 
              (by the broser), send that token to server through ajax and get search 
              results back.
      Client side FB search: Use javascript to manipulate DOMs. No need for ajax, but
              still load jquery library since it is easier to manipulate objects through
              jquery (a wrapper on DOM objects like document etc.)
